Sequencer is a grid of colored squares with names of notes written on them (C#3, E4 etc.). Each color corresponds to a different instrument.
The melody is drawn using a "paint" tool, where an instrument is picked and a note and octave are selected from dropdown menus.
Clicking on a square will set it to those values.

A "cursor" that shows the note currently being played appears as an outline around each square.
The size and height of the grid and tempo of the melody can be changed with number selection boxes (the ones with arrows).

Melodies can be sampled, so a grid setup can be saved and played separately to the grid currently being edited.
Samples are displayed in a list, and each has a play/pause button, and an "import" button that overwrites the current grid with that sample.
{Maybe capture an image of the grid for each sample, so they can be visually identified.}

{A completed grid can be exported as an audio file.}

Maybe instead of colored squares and note names, have shapes correspond to samples, and notes correspond to colors. This is more intuitive and looks nicer. Would be good to have a text-free interface.

Instead of the notes just being a line of colors along the spectrum, each note is a different hue, and the lightness of the color represents the octave. Very dark red is a deep C, slightly lighter red for C in the next octave, and so on.

CDEFGAB -> red orange yellow green blue indigo violet

Sharp notes can be represented with a little icon, like a white circle/hole in the middle of the shape.
